In the given code we can seen some code X,Y is a placeholder and placeholder's basic formula is tf.placeholder(dtype, shape=None, name=None),so at the binary X = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, 2]),i can get the x in the code is create a any number of lines and two column¡¯s matrix and every element in this matrix all float type. And w,bare variable in this program W = tf.Variable(tf.random_normal([2, 1])) is Output random values from a normal distribution. The tf.reduce_mean function is used to calculate the average of the tensor along a specified number axis (a dimension of the tensor), mainly used to reduce the dimension or calculate the average of the tensor (image). tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer is Optimizer for implementing gradient descent algorithm and in the code of model = tf.sigmoid(tf.matmul(X, W) + b) tf.sigmoid is the function who using Neural Networks . tf.matmul can make matrix X multiplied by matrix W and plus matrix b The role of sigmoid is to make a bunch of values non-linear, and its return value is between 0-1. When we pass the F obtained above into sigmoid (a = tf.sigmoid(F)), sigmoid will get the value of F according to the curve below, a, a is a decimal between 0-1, including 0 and 1. Session is a statement of Tensorflow for control, and execution of the output file. Run session.run() to get the result of the operation you want to know, or the part you want to operate on. And 
The general process of training neural networks:
1. Define the structure of the neural network and the output of the forward propagation
2. Define the loss function and the algorithm of backpropagation optimization
3. Generate a session and run the back propagation optimization algorithm repeatedly on the training data. 
 x_data = [[0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[1,1]],y_data = [[0],[1],[1],[0]] is make up some real data and define placeholder for inputs to network and then plot the real data
